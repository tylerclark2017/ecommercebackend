# E-commerce Back End

## Description
 This Module 13 Challenge, E-Commerce Back End application, was designed to teach us how to use ORM, or Object Relational Mapping, to create a backend database used by an e-commerce website. It also includes routes for category searches, product searches, and tag searches, as well as updating, deleting, and adding a category, product, and tag to the database. We also tested the routes using the Insomnia application and recorded a walkthrough of all of the routes to showcase how they work without any errors. 

 We used MySQL2 and Sequelize to connect Express to the pre-made ecommerce_db from the starter code, and the dotenv (.env) to create and use environment variables to store sensitive data (our SQL login information). We also used Node to create and seed the database. 

 ## Disclosures
 I utilized a tutor, Alexis (again, he was incredibly helpful and pushed me to learn!), and asked for help during office hours with my instructor. I also had help from the Xpert Learning Assistant to help write some of the API files code and to ensure that the routing was correct for each file in the API folder.
